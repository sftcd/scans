# scans

Various scans using zmap/xgrab/dns etc

- [name-ip](./name-ip) takes a list of DNS names and/or IP addresses as input
  and outputs a CSV file

This repo closely related to my [surveys](https://github.com/sftcd/surveys) repo.
I may move that code over to here in future, or move this to there, or otherwise 
rationalise things, but not yet:-) For the moment, it suits me better to keep
the two separate, so I will.
